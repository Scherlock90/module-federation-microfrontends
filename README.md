# module-federation-microfrontends

That is a exmaple how to create and connect microfronteds using webpack module federation

Second repository which I used to create sepreate microfrontend: https://github.com/Scherlock90/module-federation-second-app

NOTE: app-second which you see in this repository you can run on localhost enabling the comments in the app or move to seprate repository - that's is only for example.
